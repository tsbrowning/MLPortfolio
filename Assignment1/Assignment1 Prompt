1 The Dataset
A table that shows the music genre preference of each person whose name, country, age, and
gender are given as a table as follows:
NAME AGE COUNTRY GENDER MUSIC
GENRE
James 20 Germany M Rock
Tony 22 Germany M Rock
Mason 30 UK M Jazz
Mary 20 Germany F Rock
Scarlett 26 UK F Jazz
Ken 18 Spain M Pop
Lily 30 UK F Jazz
Audrey 16 UK F Pop
Hazel 18 Spain F Pop
Evelyn 18 Spain M Pop

2 Task 1
• Build a kNN classifier (k=3) by hand. Suppose we want to predict the music genre
preference of a new person with the following details: (Jane, Spain, F, 22). Calculate
by hand which music genre Jane will possibly like.
• Choosing the ML toolkit of your choice, build a kNN classifier and compare the results
with your results obtained from the hand-built classifier. 

3 Task 2
• Build a Naive Bayes classifier by hand. Suppose again we want to predict the music
genre preference of the same person (Jane, Spain, F, 22). Calculate by hand which
music genre Jane will possibly like.
• Choosing the ML toolkit of your choice, build a Naive Bayes classifier and compare
the results with your results obtained from the hand-built classifier.

4 Report
Write a report on your findings. Enclose your manual steps and your code.
